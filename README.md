# Luppul

Pull up -> pullup -> luppul

I found a site that states if I follow their plan I will be able to do 50 pull ups in a row. They offer an app to help track your progress towards that goal, but I thought it might be a good learning exercise to try and implement my own version.

This purely for learning purposes and should not be taken seriously. 50 pull ups is a lot, I hold no responsibility if you injure yourself trying complete the challenge.

# Getting started

First install the required gems
```
bundle install
```

Create and setup the database
```
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:setup
```

Run the tests
```
bundle exec rspec spec
```

Start the server
```
bundle exec rails s
```

The page will be accessible at http://localhost:3000, be ready to (not) do some pull ups.
